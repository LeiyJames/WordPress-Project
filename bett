Tech Stack:

Framework: Next.js (Static Export) or Astro.js for performance

Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules

Animations: Framer Motion or GSAP

Hosting: Vercel (for Next.js) / Netlify (for Astro)

Marketplace Links: Hardcoded product URLs or API fetches (if allowed)

Key Pages:

Homepage (Hero carousel, trending products, category filters)

Loading skeletons for better perceived performance

SEO & Performance:

Optimized for fast loading (Lazy loading, image compression)

Output Format:

Wireframe layout (Figma/ASCII)

Recommended libraries (e.g., react-slick for carousels)

Sample code snippets (e.g., marketplace button component)

Deployment checklist

Bonus: Suggest how to handle product data (manual JSON vs. scraping APIs if allowed)."





Instant Marketplace Redirection

"Buy Now" buttons that deep-link directly to the product on Shoppee/Lazada/TikTok Shop.

Example: A single product page shows all marketplace options with price comparisons.

AI-Powered "Style Match" Widget

Users upload a photo (or select a celebrity style), and the site recommends similar items from linked marketplaces.

Tech: TensorFlow.js (client-side, no backend) or pre-built APIs like Google Vision.

Real-Time Price Comparison Tool

Scrape (or manually update) prices from each marketplace to show the best deal.

Example: "This dress is ₱1,200 on Lazada vs. ₱1,500 on TikTok Shop."

TikTok/Instagram Reels Integration

Embed trending TikTok videos wearing your products (with "Shop Now" links).

Bonus: Add a "As Seen on TikTok" badge to high-demand items.

One-Click Wishlist (Local Storage)

Save products to a wishlist using localStorage (no login needed).

Example: "Heart" icon adds items to a /wishlist page with marketplace links.

Flash Deal Countdown Timer

Pull upcoming sales events from marketplaces and display urgency timers.

Tech: Hardcoded JSON or use Shoppee/Lazada’s public sale API.

Augmented Reality (AR) Try-On

Use TikTok’s or Snap’s AR filters to let users "try" glasses/hats virtually.

Low-code option: Link to TikTok Shop’s built-in AR feature.





A. UX/UI Enhancements
Skeleton Loading for marketplace data (avoids blank screens while links load).

Dark Mode Toggle (Tailwind CSS makes this easy).

Micro-interactions (e.g., button hover effects, cart icon bounce).

B. Performance Optimizations
Lazy-load images (use Next.js next/image or loading="lazy").

Prefetch marketplace links when hovering over buttons.

Static Site Generation (SSG) for SEO (Next.js/Astro).

C. Low-Effort Marketing Wins
Hashtag Generator: "Copy this TikTok caption for 10% off!" (links to marketplace).

User-Generated Content (UGC) Section: Embed Instagram posts with product tags.

QR Codes: Print QR codes on packaging linking back to the site.

D. Tech Stack Additions
Analytics: Vercel Analytics (free) or Google Tag Manager for tracking clicks.

Error Handling: Detect broken marketplace links and show alternatives.
